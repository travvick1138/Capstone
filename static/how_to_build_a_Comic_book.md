#How To Build a Comic Book...

## The Theoretical Parts
* Cover, this is your gotcha. Comics are the only books ever judged by their cover, in my humble opinion.
* front inside cover, this could be your copyright page or you business card or you could put your first page of your story.
* page 1 and so on until your last page, Comics are generally 22pages long for most comic companies want to see 3 consecutive pages of story plus examples of finished art
* Back inside cover, it could be your last page of art, an expression of what comes next ,or it could be a letter to the editor and yes, if you do this it should be to the specific editor of the specific company you are sending it to
* Back cover, this could be more examples of your art work, a bio about you, or cover letter as I said before.

## The Practical Parts
* All objects have to be stored as an image file either .jpg or .png (even your document type files)
    * although I will no give a full explanation here save your doc files as to pdf and then follow instructions here http://www.wikihow.com/Convert-PDF-to-Image-Files
* All files have to have the same image size for example if your first image is 1988x3065 then all of your images need to be that same size
    * One caveat is when you have a double page.
* All files must be of a single type, so all .jpg or all .png no mixing and matching.
* All files need to be labeled in the order you want to show them from 000 to 999
    * Examples:
    * my-comic-000.jpg
    * 000.png

### Saving your Comic Book file
* Once you have loaded your files press save and you will now be prompted with some choices and requirements
    * Set your Comic File Name
    * Set your Volume Number 001 or don't and it will default 001
    * Set issue number 001 - 999 or don't and it will default 001
    * Set your content rating level (required)
        * E - EVERYONE (all ages, may contain minimal violence)
        * T - TEEN (12 and up, may contain mild violence or mild profanity)
        * T+ - TEEN PLUS (16 and up, may contain moderate violence, moderate profanity use and suggestive themes )
        * M - MATURE (18 and up, may contain nudity, profanity, excessive violence and other content not suitable for minors)
    * Set your content to share, default is hidden.
